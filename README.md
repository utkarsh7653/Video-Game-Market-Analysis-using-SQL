# Video-Game-Market-Analysis-using-SQL
This personal project aims to analyze the overall market of video game using Postgresql 
The attached presentation pdf consists of all the queries executed along with the insight's explanation.
In this analysis, I explored various factors influencing the success of video games in different global markets. Using a dataset containing information about video game sales, platforms, genres, publishers, and regional sales, I performed several SQL queries to uncover insights and trends.
Firstly, I analyzed the recent sales trends, highlighting games that have performed well or poorly in recent years. This can help identify consumer preferences and demand for new and unique games.
Next, I identified the top-tier publishers dominating the gaming industry, particularly in the North American region. Understanding the strategies employed by these successful publishers can provide valuable insights for other companies.
I also examined the games and platforms that are popular in specific regions, such as the widespread popularity of Wii Sports in Europe and the preference for certain gaming platforms like PS3 in Europe, DS in Japan, and Wii in North America.
Furthermore, I analyzed the sales trends by genre, revealing that action, sports, and shooter games are fan favorites in the North American market, potentially indicating profitable segments for growth.
The analysis also covered the cumulative sales trends in the North American market, highlighting the overall growth pattern and the impressive global sales performance of Wii Sports.
Additionally, I explored the global sales trends for games released in the year 2000 and later, identifying periods of peak sales, such as 2007, 2008, and 2009.
Finally, based on the insights derived from this analysis, I provided potential strategies and recommendations, such as focusing on developing games for popular platforms and genres in specific regions, and considering the publishing strategies employed by top-tier publishers.
Overall, this comprehensive analysis leverages SQL queries and data visualization techniques to uncover valuable insights into the video game market, enabling informed decision-making for companies in the gaming industry.
